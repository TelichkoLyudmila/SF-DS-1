### Project Description    
HeadHunter company wants to build a model that would automatically determine the approximate salary level suitable for the user based on the information they provided about themselves. The task is to transform and clean the data.

### Problem Statement    
1. Basic analysis of data structure
2. Data transformation
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Data cleaning

**Competition Conditions:**  
The initial data has duplicate features, missing values, outliers, many variables are formatted in a way that cannot be used in modeling.

**Quality Metric**     
In the end, the data should be prepared for DS modeling.

**Practiced Techniques**     
Learn to transform, explore, and clean large volumes of data.

### Brief Data Overview
Training data is attached in the data section.

### Project Workflow  
1. Basic analysis of data structure (data extraction and introduction)
2. Data transformation (formation of features that can be used in modeling)
3. Exploratory data analysis (finding dependencies between factors, visualization with the plotly library - graphs are in the project body in the folder with the same name)
4. Data cleaning (cleaning from outliers, filling in missing values, removing duplicates)

### Results:  
The data has been transformed and is ready for use in models.

### Conclusions:  
Data transformation takes a very large amount of time, visualization significantly simplifies the process.
