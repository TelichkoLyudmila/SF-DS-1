### Project Description    
Participate in a competition and clean the data/create new features to minimize the target metric MAPE. After that, forecast user ratings for Booking using a random forest model.

### Problem Statement    

1. Removal of string values, handling missing values
2. Feature engineering, feature transformation 
3. Feature selection
4. Model tuning and training, minimizing the target variable

**Competition Conditions:**  
Standard Kaggle competition, aiming to achieve the minimum deviation from the predicted data on the test set.

**Quality Metric**     
MAPE, auxiliary MAE

**Practiced Techniques**     
Learn to process various numerical and categorical features, create categorical features from text features, basic model training, improve the target variable.

### Brief Data Overview
Data on Kaggle is presented in the form of two sets: train and test, and the result of the model's prediction needs to be uploaded to the third file, submission.

### Project Workflow  
- Removal of string values
- Handling missing values
- Feature engineering
- Feature transformation
- Feature selection
- Model training, minimizing the target variable

### Results:  
MAPE improved from 14 to 12.5

### Conclusions:  
Feature transformation, standardization, and encoding can significantly improve model performance.
