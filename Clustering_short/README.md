### Project Description

The case involves practicing various clustering methods and identifying weaknesses in the DBSCAN method.

### Problem Statement

Task: Cluster customers based on their profile (age, gender, annual income, or spending score).

**Competition Conditions:**
Clearly defined clusters, metric maximization.

**Quality Metric:**
Completeness metric.

**Practiced Techniques:**
DBSCAN clustering and hierarchical clustering.

### Brief Data Overview

The data is in CSV format and includes customer profile data (age, gender, annual income, or spending score).

### Project Workflow

1. Data preprocessing.
2. DBSCAN clustering.
3. Hierarchical clustering.

### Results

After comparing DBSCAN and hierarchical clustering, the latter gave better results. Due to sparse data and outliers, the DBSCAN method performed poorly.

### Conclusions

It was possible to achieve a completeness metric of 90% and clearly defined clusters using hierarchical clustering.
